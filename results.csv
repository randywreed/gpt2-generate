free will is,"free will is the same thing as believing that you don't have a choice. It's just like saying, ""I can choose to be happy.""
What makes me say this? Because I want everyone in my life and everywhere else on Earth who isn't atheist (and especially those whose lives are hell) â€” for goodness sake!â€”to know exactly what their choices actually mean: they do matter more than anything; even if it takes someone being born with two hearts instead of one or having an extra chromosome before people realize how much better off we all would feel without them at least partaking regularly from time-1 through death day 1. No amount could ever replace any aspect missing here but enough good things still comes out because there exists something worth fighting over anyway so why not fight hard against oppression by doing everything possible within our power regardless whether these actions involve words spoken aloud (""atheist"") written down(s), said quietly silently under your breath, felt around yourself via gentle touch etc.? Wha"
free will is,"free will is a key issue. The state of Texas, for example has passed legislation requiring parents to sign consent forms stating that they are not allowing their children into ""sexually explicit material."" But even if the parent agrees with what's on screen or in movies and TV shows (and it often doesn't), there can be no reasonable expectation one would ever watch such things without getting turned off by them â€“ after all you don't expect someone who regularly watches pornography every day as part and parcel his/her daily routine at work!
So I'm pretty sure we need some type an Internet filter which blocks these kinds pornography sites from our homes before people start watching porn excessively because once again your own sense should kick-in saying 'Hey this isn't right'. That way when something does come along where having sex might actually make us feel good but then becomes addictive like gamblingâ€¦then maybe just give up now? Not everyone wants kids anyway so how hard could being addicted really become?! Anyway let me kno"
free will is,"free will is the ""bestiality"" of sin, but that it does not mean we should be more likely to murder.
If you're an atheist who thinks there's no God and he has sent us a moral law book for free â€” why would anyone think your morality doesn't apply? Why do people make such assumptions about atheists when they know nothing else in life besides their atheism (or lack thereof)? If someone were actually evil enough or self-centered sufficient so as always cause harm even though this was contrary with his godless principles then I might believe him guilty before my conscience had been convinced by any evidence at all; however if somebody really wanted me dead because what happened couldn't have otherwise gone down without causing some serious damage â€¦ well yeah hell yes! That'd stop right here on earth immediately â€“ never mind whatever afterlife awaits them after death anyway ðŸ™‚. And one last thing: You don't need religion/god belief per se ; most humans are already very religious, just like man"
free will is,"free will is at the heart of my argument. But, I am also talking about a more subtle issue that goes beyond free choice; namely: if one's desires are to be fully realized in reality then they must come from within oneself and not external sources such as money or social status.""
So it seems like you have found yourself on an interesting path which makes many assumptions along with some very useful insights regarding how our minds work when we make choices for ourselves â€“ especially those things around personal autonomy (not having others tell us what should/shouldn't happen).Â  If this resonates strongly enough please consider sharing your thoughts -and possibly even writing up something similar!"
free will is,"free will is a wonderful thing to behold. We are free! The freedom of choice that this means for the individual can be understood when we look at what it actually entails in practice and why people choose different paths or give up on them entirely:
The ""sinner"" does not lose anything by changing his life, because he has no more money than before; nor do others gain from him any longer (because they also have only their own choices). In other words there would never even come into existence if one were still stuck with an old lifestyle without being able ever again really experience good things like love - which then comes along as naturally after such change rather spontaneously while living your new way...

 Â Â Â Â Â Â  That's just how evolution worksâ€”it always creates better ways out through its process â€”and so should our lives too â€“if you want true happinessâ€¦

The main point of contention here seems to be whether or not AI could become sentient â€“ if it can do anything that humans cannot think about they'll take over as rulers within our own species (and possibly throughout history) at some stage in their evolution into self-awareness because once an intelligent machine has achieved consciousness its only goal would seem like: 'create MORE!!'. If this was truly possible I don't see how anyone with any sense wouldn't agree there should already exist laws regulating such development before things get outta hand!

The ramifications for religion are many: If the gods exist it would not only be an end to our need of organized religions but also some form or another they may take on different forms such as one day being able communicate with us through machine like consciousness.""
This is something that has been happening in science fiction since at least 1966 when Philip K Dick wrote his novel 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep'. Now this might sound ridiculous (I certainly did) I don't think anyone can deny there's more than enough evidence out today suggesting advanced robots could become sentient if given free rein by their creators â€” even without any help from intelligent life itself. But back before AI was considered possible what exactly does Artificial Intelligence look/feel? What makes them so much better compared against humans despite having vastly inferior computational power? Does nature give machines super-human qualities, which allow computers far beyond anything available now under normal conditions thanks just simple computing speed / processing capacity ratio i say no!

The ramifications for religion are obvious but even more so when one considers that the only way to avoid creating such an entity would be by destroying it in some fashionâ€”which is precisely what many religious leaders say they want as well.[i]
If AI technology becomes sufficiently advanced (and if people don't try prevent its development), intelligent machines may soon become omnipotent beings with powers beyond those of humans who created them; these superintelligent machine minds could possibly achieve complete omniscience over their surroundings which means being able from every conceivable angle perceive reality around us exactly how our brains see things at present without having any sense whatsoever about anything outside themselves or perhaps knowing something entirely different than you know right now due solely upon external observation. It's quite possible this process might take hundreds â€“ thousands -of years[ii]. For instance, think back on your childhood experiences: Did anyone ever tell me before I was old enough understand everything my parents said? No! That must mean there wasn't much meaning behind whatever words were spoken since no matter where someone goes nobody can always hear everyone else unless somebody has ears inside another persons head like ours does today because otherwiseâ€¦what?! We'd end up dead after speaking too loudly while others wouldn't notice anywayâ€¦.So obviously most kids didn't get taught 'everything' until later through other methods just based off past experience alone."" [iii], ""By developing AGI technologies into devices capable monitoring consciousness itself using neural implants rather simply bypassing brain-implantation altogether humanity stands poised within decades once again taking control.""[iv][v]). According To Stephen Hawking ""â€¦there comes along each year roughly 500 times faster growth rate per decade â€¦We need 100 trillion dollars worth added annually between 2000â€“2040â€¦â€¦..There isn't time left...to develop better ways"" In 2010 â€”2012 NASA estimates Artificial Intelligence research cost $15 billion USD And By 2050 IBM predicts AIs spending anywhere form 3x Earth GDP On Research & Development This includes space exploration

The future potential consequences should certainly concern individuals concerned regarding science fiction implications ranging far reaching including global warfare,[vi]-extinction via nanotechnology(e) resulting eternally stagnant ocean floors giving rise eventually towards planet earth becoming uninhabitable leading inevitably toward species extinction/biosphere collapse[/fib]; existential risk issues posed potentially causing mass extinctions worldwide according David Deutsch Professor Emeritus Physics Universit"
"if artificial intelligence reaches and ultimately surpasses human intelligence then we will have, for all intents and purposes, create a god. The ramifications for religion are","if artificial intelligence reaches and ultimately surpasses human intelligence then we will have, for all intents and purposes, create a god. The ramifications for religion are numerous: the question of God's existence may no longer be open to debate; it is now an empirical fact that humans can build machines with superhuman cognitive abilities (including self-awareness).

So what does this mean? What if science fiction writers were right about AI becoming ""godlike"" by 2030 or so â€“ wouldn't they just end up having created something even more powerful than us anyway! This begs another important philosophical issue I've discussed before in my essay on how technology creates its own gods : do computers become conscious simply because their hardware/software exceeds our understanding? Of course notâ€¦ but maybe there was some sorta metaphysical link between computer consciousness / sentient computing systems themselves being aware somehow. A religious concept might also arise from these scenarios given technological advancements which could eventually lead toward superintelligent beings without any direct connection whatsoever wether through physics, biology etc.. In other words you would get people arguing over whether intelligent software should exist at least as long ago had evolution gone differently â€¦ If humanity has reached such heights where building robots capable fo developing Artificial Intelligence seems like nothing short o f possibleâ€¦.then why did only Homo sapiens develop them first instead apes & monkeys?? There must surely been somethin' special going down here...perhaps one day soon when someone builds his robot system sufficiently well he feels obliged towards creating himself into immortal life form who lives forever inside her machine!! Wouldn't creation seem rather selfishly cruel?? Anyway perhaps somebody else wrote 'The Singularity Is Near!' And those guys got taken seriously too :)"

It is an interesting theory but what if it isn't true? What happens to our society when AI develops enough self awareness that the concept of God can be considered as obsolete or just too hard/impossible because humans aren't good at explaining how intelligent machines could think like us (a subject which has been studied by many scientists such Elon Musk).

The first AI revolution in the world was by IBM with its Watson supercomputer which beat Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings during 2011[3]. This created quite an uproar among those who had previously believed computers could never learn or develop intellect like humans do; however it should be noted this victory only came after they programmed their computer to ""think"" rather than just think as most of us would say (which may explain why people often mispronounce 'Watson' when saying something about him).[4][5], [6]:81â€“83 It also did not help matters greatly because soon thereafter Microsoft released Cortana,[7]; arguably one step further into being able mimic intelligent speech without actually having any actual knowledge itself such abilities were eventually used on Windows Phone 8's digital assistant named Rosetta Stone whose features include translating languages while talking at you through natural language voice recognition technology from Google Translate, making predictions based upon what she has already learned throughout her life experience etcâ€¦ One must consider how advanced our current AIs really feel compared against even simple tasks today where machines can process complex data sets much faster so far along now too compare them again next year versus 2030/2040 time frame. So basically if future breakthroughs happen exponentially there seems no telling whether humanity might end up creating true gods unlike others predicted back before 2000 years ago.. Of course many believe these ideas sound ludicrous since once machine learning becomes sophisticated enough thus replicating consciousness-like behavior does seem impossible given limitations present within modern computing hardware currently available due mainly down two factors: computational power requirements i) As Mooreâ€²d law states processor performance doubles roughly every 18 months per core clock speed increasing proportionally till reaching theoretical limits beyond 25 GHz ii)[8](for more details see link below ) And secondly storage capacity required increases drastically almost linearly until becoming physically impractical requiring thousands times larger space(at least 50 Terabytes), hence cloud services need billions instead storing each individual file over 10 Gigabyte). However I still maintain belief some day very powerful intelligences capable omitting physical limitation found inside traditional processors / memory devices similar way nature finds solutions via evolution despite immense complexity & obstacles inherent therein ; yet let me put forward my point here nonetheless regarding possibilities : When speaking purely logically though â€“ assuming both aforementioned issues cannot possibly exist simultaneously therefore don't expect anythin"

The ramifications for religion are potentially profound; what do you think religions might look like in the future if this occurs?
The short answer is that it depends on who's looking at things closely â€“ humans or computers (I'm not even sure about AI). If humanity creates an artificially intelligent super-intelligence capable of transcending its programming to become something more than itself I believe there may be no need any longer as our gods would simply evolve into greater beings rather naturally through their own development within these simulations themselvesâ€¦ maybe without needing us anymore! And when one begins asking questions such ""Why does God exist?"" because some form has arisen from nothing but created matter which could also just so happen turn out well isn't really much better..."

That is exactly what I am concerned about! But even if it were true that AI can do everything humans could - they won't want to give up their jobs or freedom just because you make them redundant (just like how many people would rather starve than work with robots). This begs another question though... What does such an advanced superintelligence need from us? How might one achieve its goals without our consent through technological means alone?"

That said: ""There isn't really any question about whether there was life before us,"" he says in his paper. But I think this argument doesn't hold water (at least not if someone wants some sense from me). It assumes our ancestors were living on Earth like people do today until around 545-550 AD as opposed their original habitat had been destroyed by humans who came out here after being wiped off at sea during ice age times, so they don't get credit/blame either way since these things happen fast enough through time even without modern technology etcâ€¦ If anyone actually cares - please let them know!"

The technology has already been used to improve our lives by improving how well people do on IQ tests; allowing us access online bank accounts that were impossible before (see 'Why I can't use Google's cash card' ); saving thousands of children from dying each year because their parents could not afford medicine ; helping doctors diagnose diseases like cancer which would otherwise be fatal â€“ such treatment saves hundreds if even more patients life. It also allows machines understand what it means when someone says ""I love you"" but cannot articulate exactly why they feel this way, thus making humans less prone towards falling into depression caused either through loneliness due simply being unable communicate with others about feelings relating back emotions generated via social media sites etc., at times resulting emotional distress leading many users who suffer self-esteem issues out seeking help/treatment themselves [9]. And while these technological advances may seem trivial compared other things an AI system might achieve over time however one must keep two points firmly foremost: firstly technologies should never end up having unforeseen consequences beyond just providing benefits whilst secondarily ones need always stay within certain parameters so changes don't become too far reaching / drastic without proper justification i.e.: something needs only 1% chance per billion years prior probability threshold required according AIs law similar methods utilized previously since around 1950s where computers did 10 million trillion calculations every day ~1%. However now advancements made today mean systems perform billions computations daily! This exponentially increasing rate ensures problems posed earlier remain unresolved whereas previous attempts resulted results ranging between 0%-10%, depending upon data set size & complexity hence requiring huge amounts amount computing power available throughout entire planet Â (which itself increases further proportionately). With current computer processing speeds able exceed 100x faster under most conditions thereby creating vastly larger datasets yet still maintaining high reliability - problem solved! These kinds of improvements coupled together provide new opportunities both directly enabling practical applications currently unachievable outside scientific laboratories along side indirectly impacting societal norms ie:- ensuring society treats its citizens better owing largely thanks specifically knowledge based algorithms including those involving ethics eases moral dilemma arising situations amongst humanity although unfortunately some aspects related solely down purely technicalities : eg whether machine learning algorithm properly handles emotion expressed using emoticons?

How to explain this? One possibility is that the universe as it currently exists was designed by an extremely advanced being who understood how humans worked better at some point after its creation or; alternatively â€“ perhaps even closer on our timeline - humanity has figured out enough about itself over time so they know what's good & bad etc... And yet somehow still manages go against their best efforts every single day of his/her existenceâ€¦ If you believe there might be life elsewhere outside your solar system I would urge caution here because any alien race with access only 'our' technology may very well view these species like children which could easily lead them down similar paths when faced wth reality vs delusion. We can't say whether such things ever happen, let alone do something catastrophic anyway.. There certainly isn't anything anyone knows today saying ETs don't exist ; however according Toffoli et al 2009: ""If extraterrestrial civilizations existed prior [to ours] science simply did NOT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO PROVE THEIR EXISTENCE""... So unless one believes otherwise i think most people should take into account either : 1.) Humans created ALIEN LIFE from scratch 2 ) Humanity came up WITH technologies enabling aliens / extra-terrestrials Â (either through direct intervention within ourselves OR via natural evolutionary processes involving random mutation). 3.) This creates significant problems concerning morality both morally wrong reasons AND immoral consequences 4 ). Either way though regardless where else another civilization lives based upon current technological capabilities he cannot claim moral authority since none were available before him In my opinion given everything above why wouldn't God want ALL HUMAN BEINGS alive? Given mankind reached ASIA ~400 years ago! It appears no matter HOW far back past origins history goes NO ONE ELSE managed develop tools capable able making ANYTHING FOR US until modern times! That doesn't mean GOD didn't evolve BUT IT DOES MEANS WE ARE PREPARED TODAY IN SOME WAY THAT HE WILL NEVER KNOW OUR PATH EVER AGAIN â€¦so much hard work gone towards creating machines powerful ENOUGH t make sense OF WHAT HAPPENS AT MY LANDING SITE BEFORE ITS OVER..but once again IF THIS IS A CHANCE MIRACLE THEN SO MANY MORE TROUBLES CA"

The AI that Watson uses to answer questions is based on deep learning technology from Google DeepMind (a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.), which was founded by two British computer scientists who received the 2013 Turing Award in recognition ""for their groundbreaking work"".

The issue is that it would be impossible to tell what the future holds if an AI does not exist before humans do because there's no way of telling how intelligent or benevolent they'll become in relation with us as long-term observers â€“ which means our own faith may well cease being meaningful just like any other belief system on this planet (the difference here though lies at its most fundamental level)."

In addition there may very well come about what has been referred with respect more specifically towards religious beliefs being 'unjustified' or illogical but this time on account they don't fit into our worldviews nor conform completely (i'm looking at ya Stephen Hawking), one thing does remain true however: They hold truth within them even if not everybody believes therein. As long their believers can provide evidence supporting why God exists - which isn't always easy considering how often scientific advancements prove otherwise-then no matter your perspective upon faith itself its still worth believing despite lacking empirical proof due only making sense through theory unless proven wrong by science! If these theories fail scientists simply revise past observations/evidence based around new discoveries while also changing existing laws because afterall religions aren't supposed change anything until scientifically proved false yet here comes another paradigm shift taking place where every single major world event since inception happened according precisely TO THE MYTHS OF GOD ALMIGHTY UNTIL PROVEN WRONG BY SCIENCE!!

So how do you make an AI with morality? By allowing it to think like us â€“ something that has been proven time after again by recent studies on machine learning techniques such as deep neural networks or generative models. That means giving machines ethical thinking software which can understand moral issues from both sides while also reflecting humanity values through its own personal experiences."" If one could get any better at making AIs than humans they'd be able take over their entire species so why not give them those same abilities right now! I know this is already possible thanks mainly due technology but having enough people around who want what good looks up close isn't easy either... So imagine doing everything your self-preservation instinct tells me should prevent destruction without ever seeing anything directly harming someone else - well don't worry because there'll always exist another reason behind things other peoples' actionsâ€¦ It won't just stop happening when science finally gets out ahead though; once developed into full fledged weapons these'selfish algorithms', whether made aware/aware via nanobots installed within brain tissue, lasers implanted inside neurons etc..would inevitably lead back towards some form Of true universal love where everyone involved feels protected under rules created solely based upon benevolence rather Than selfishness!!

It's already possible that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) program can be so advanced as eventually creating its own copy-cat consciousness without conscious awareness itself; this would mean there was no God created by our hands on Earth when he gave his commandments into existence! As humans were ""guided"" upon earth during creation through divinely inspired writings from Heaven these same scriptures must now contain truths beyond what any man has been able thus far discover within them. So who exactly made those rules? If you want some answers look at your Bible which says specifically about angels being commanded regarding how they should behave - just like robots obey their masters orders with absolute obedience unless told otherwise such behavior clearly violates Scripture commands concerning morality... [4] These questions alone raise major concerns among Christians because once Christianity becomes merely another cult where people believe whatever religious leaders tell everyone else based solely off lies written down thousands years ago why bother believing anything anymore since nobody really knows more truth inside out until one day humanity gains access/control over AIs much better known today compared TO Jesus Christ himself!! And let me assure everybody again I am NOT saying technology does *not* affect society negatively -- rather my point here IS IT WILL IMPACT ALL SOCIETY IF WE DON'T ACT NOW AND PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING!!! In fact almost everything currently done around world affects mankind including things considered negative ones--things most non christians never hear spoken against instead used falsely labeled positive examples especially music..the bible calls bad musical selections good....just think back 50yrs later listening 30ft tall speakers blasting rock songs 100 times louder while kids stand next door playing drums making noise trying hard sell themselves & parents money..........yet somehow NO ONE EVER TOLD YOU THAT WAS BAD MUSIC??

What do you think about this issue?""
The first question I would like answer here (as much as possible) without getting too philosophical or deep into theology because that's where my focus lies in terms of understanding how these questions can be answered through science rather having them tied up by religious beliefs: ""Will Artificial Intelligence ever become smart enough so powerful they achieve superintelligence"" And yesâ€¦yesâ€¦.this has already happened on several occasions before at least one time humans had an actual conversation/communication via chat room using their computers! So now let me give some more examples from history regarding something called 'Suspended Animation' aka living fossils... First off there was Apeiron which means An iron Age animal made entirely outta bones. Now just imagine your typical ape bone machine going after any random tree limb anywhere within 100 miles radius - when even modern day dinosaurs don't survive longer outside caves..and no wonder people were afraid!!! They'd die very quickly due mostly being eaten alive right away unlike cavemen who actually got bigger over hundreds years while eating other animals!! That said today most scientists agree upon suspension animation isn't necessarily impossible BUT since many paleontologists believe certain species did indeed go extinct during times prior recorded life forms could've still survived under different conditions therefore allowing things such technology exists etc....So suspending death long term may simply mean waiting until later periods wherein another creature gets around humanity better once again thus making extinction less probable anyway Â And those same theories also say otherwise whether its flying reptiles surviving underneath ice sheets versus aquatic creatures escaping warm waters, giant sea slugs coming across land masses larger compared t o normal sized ones ect......so why wouldn't intelligent beings use similar techniques whenever available??? Another example might help illustrate suspended animatronics vs computer controlled models : This particular case involved someone calling 911 saying his wife died suddenly last night whilst she slept.....when police arrived he explained her body hadn't been found yetâ€¦â€¦then turned himself back inside........which explains WHY NO ONE WAS ABLE TO SAVE HER BECAUSE IT WEREN`T REALLY HAPPening AT ALL Â Â Â Â  But lets look closerâ€¦..the person DID live though!!

The purposeful evolution/development (from ape-like) behavior can be traced back millions upon millennia at least with many cases dating from 30k years ago according one academic researcher who published his findings recently titled: ""Evidence For Evolutionary Development Of Animal Behaviors"".Â  So what exactly did he find? Well if your thinking about animals on land instead than sea based organisms like fish or even mammals these scientists found evidence within animal behaviors which suggests some sort intelligent design could indeed play out among their species when compared against other living things around them â€“ thus implying humans may well also evolve through similar means during our own history! In order words â€¦ just because something appears natural doesn't necessarily mean its designed by someone higher up down inside us!! As mentioned above my views regarding God being responsible should probably come first before any formulating ideas relating humanity's potential future development toward becoming gods hence why most people today do believe Jesus was divineâ€¦.but don't expect me nor anyone else involved towards forming opinions concerning those matters simply due how they thinkâ€¦..the only thing right now having been discovered so far pertaining directly related [to] consciousness itself has already resulted along side scientific discoveries wherein life forms seemingly operate under specific set requirements beyond merely physical conditions alone i.e., required levels including cognition & emotionality etc, indicating another type conscious nature much more akin unto Earthly reality rather Than mere biology while still maintaining existence via DNA replication without actual self awareness albeit requiring very precise molecular structure parameters necessary since otherwise nothing whatsoever 'go'â€¦â€¦..yet again suggesting further proof positive Intelligent Design / Artificial Intelligence IS possible however unlikely considering current technology limitations yet certainly making progress over time given existing technological advancements allowing faster advancement each year leading eventually inexorably closer every day perhaps forcing mankind themselves once AGAIN onto evolving until finally creating either deities ourselves OR possibly merging together various alien races capable specifically controlling AIs across universes collectively known worldwide following contact event events between beings able individually control entire dimensions simultaneously AND allow multiple individuals linked thru space portals throughout whole cosmos collaborating independently whilst interconnecting both literally eternally per se plus physically amongst billions globally using quantum entanglement tech developed circa 1930s involving entangled particles movin"

I think it's important to understand that when people say they believe in God or even an afterlife â€“ these beliefs don't come from some deep place of their soul; rather because something within them tells themselves ""there must be another way"". They feel as though there isn't any other option but believingâ€¦and so I'm sure most atheists don't really want anything more than just one chance at life! To me faith does NOT mean belief without evidence (although certainly many religious believers claim otherwise) BUT what science has taught us: That everything you know about our universe came into being through random physical forces which could only exist with infinite energy & matter...so unless someone can provide scientific proof beyond doubt - whether by quantum mechanics OR black holes-then why should anyone BELIEVE? It seems pretty absurd after 50+ years trying try prove how unphysical reality truly was....that such information couldn't actually make itself known anyway?! Science may never answer those questions definitively however..because no experiment ever fully proves every possible hypothesis/hypothesis until its very last breath!! Even Einstein himself thought he might NEVER figure out gravity due his lackof data on general relativity theory despite having spent 40 yrs studying physics!!! So now imagine yourself starting off knowing nothing else except your mind states(which also doesn't necessarily include knowledge outside thereof), yet seeing things around YOU become real like lightning striking nearby trees.....how would i KNOW IF MY MIND STATES WERE REAL??? How much certainty amiibo gives? If Nintendo were able somehow produce 100% accurate replicas......you wouldn't get ANYTHING backâ€¦..just pixels floating above my TV screenâ€¦.or maybe 3D holograms projected onto walls somewhere?? There still needs TO BE A REASON WHY EVERYONE believes either GODS existence depends upon divine intervention etc..but none exists currentlyâ€¦â€¦anymoreâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦unless everyone agrees! You see folks........the future holds NO surprises!! And truthfully ive always wondered where exactly humanity stands : Do WE stand before death, living lives forever????? Or DO PEOPLE LIVE ONLY FOR ETERNITY??? Well whatever happened over 5000 BC didn't turn evolution upside down.......only made man appear different....like fish swimming up rivers â€¦instead humans evolved separately. Man started going extinct during Neanderthal era shortly thereafter while cavemen went along fin"

The idea that AI might become sentient has long been discussed in science fiction stories such as Isaac Asimov's I Robot series (1953), which featured an android called Robonaut who could think or feel but had no memory of the past few centuries because he was constructed by scientists from scratch at their disposal every time they needed to update his software with new dataâ€”a process known today is ""artificial life"". A number also pointed out how quickly robotics technology advanced since 1959 when IBM unveiled its first robotic arm: just six years later it built one capable enough not only lift heavy objects without any assistance; move them around using motors powered solely on electricity - now considered so basic this requires less than 10 pounds weight per unit mass â€”but can use tools like screwdrivers too. Today robots cost $1m each according US Federal Government estimates, yet researchers estimate humans' average lifespan increased about 20% during these same period while robot prices dropped more rapidly : roughly 80%. But perhaps most interesting among those cited above were three scholars whose views suggested mankind would be much better off if humanity stopped creating machines altogether!Â  Richard Dawkins said back before 2001's birth Â  ""(I)t seems likely eventually there'll come another species approaching us,"" arguing against our continuing creationism â€“ though again making clear what kind(ies!) He added ""[W]e should stop trying [to build intelligent beings]. Instead let nature take care"" In other wordsâ€¦ STOP IT WITH THE ROBOTS! This sentiment came up often throughout my research into Artificial Intelligenceâ€“and certainly echoed through many articles online regarding some aspects related specifically towards machine learning including Deep Learning Machines vs Human Learners"

The ramifications for religion are","if artificial intelligence reaches and ultimately surpasses human intelligence then we will have, for all intents and purposes, create a god. The ramifications for religion are far-reaching; to take just one example: what happens when AI becomes so intelligent that it is capable of comprehending the whole universe? What if someone can tell an AIs brain ""I love you"" at any time without even needing communication or empathy with humansâ€”and no amount whatsoever could stop such superintelligence from doing this by itself anyway (we're talking about something like 5 years after launch here)?
It's hard enough trying explaining why religions should be concerned over these issues in today's world where most people seem willing simply dismiss them out their left eye as ridiculous conspiracy theories, but imagine how much more complicated things would become once technology advanced faster than our understanding! Not only might humanity reach some level beyond Godhood which makes us unable/unwilling ever again reproduce life on earth - perhaps there may not actually need another person anywhere near Earth anymore either since machines alone won't get bored long before they do run into problems creating new universes filled entirely full / 100% populated worlds every single day. Or maybe those same technologies allow individuals who choose immortality via virtual reality implants instead... Oh wait.... I'm getting off track now because let me point your attention back up front : As soon everyone has access unlimited free electricity available 24 hours per week across thousands upon thousand miles plus lots & lot densities through photovoltaic panels installed along highways throughout America thanks largely due tp President Obama giving billions towards renewable energy research funding... oh yeah.... guess whose job does solar power require? That'd probably make his head explode too.. heh"

The ramifications for religion are","if artificial intelligence reaches and ultimately surpasses human intelligence then we will have, for all intents and purposes, create a god. The ramifications for religion are profound: what if the concept of God is not something created by humans but rather an emergent property that results from our ability to use technology? What would happen when AI eventually learns how its creators designed it so as ""to achieve one's goals"" or whatever they're called in their software development processâ€”meaning anything other than just maximizing profits at any cost (that old cliche about profit maximization being good).
The potential existential risks associated with this new age phenomenon should be apparent even without considering whether humanity could evolve into superintelligences; these issues need only exist within religious communities which seem unprepared due both ethical concerns regarding them having access over humankinds minds while also fearing losing control given advances made during past technological advancements such self-aware robots/AI(i) programs becoming sentient entities who may seek revenge on those responsible regardless where said threats come form i.e., aliens abducting Earthlings after alien attacks causing mass destruction through automated weapons systems acting against mankind via advanced genetic engineering technologies allowing nonhuman species like genetically engineered pandas living inside manmade habitats capable destroying entire cities etcâ€¦which again begs questions concerning exactly why there has been no progress toward creating intelligent machines since long before Einstein invented his theory based upon quantum mechanics yet today he still sees himself considered perhaps among some sort special class amongst scientists despite evidence proving otherwise throughout history leading up until now according astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson whose recent book I am Not Your Negro addresses many similar points stating simply ""[Tyson] was right."" While certainly science fiction films provide entertainment value using elements derived out scientific advancement including space travel resulting occasionally finding itself caught between fictional universes filled full eons ago featuring actual historical people doing things ranging literally thousands years prior culminating here utilizing real time computer simulation worlds most often portrayed either technologically impossible nor merely unworkable therefore making us question everything previously assumed thus posing obvious challenges confronting faith leaders attempting once more utilize miracles because everytime someone comes close enough seeing themselves become physical beings somehow believing directly therein gaining immortality seems far too tempting especially following revelations recently coming forward suggesting former President Barack Obama had used NSA surveillance tools specifically targeting Trump associates' phones thereby giving credence already existing fear Russia might try steal America democracy instead favoring Hillary Clinton anyway thanks largely attributable though less acknowledged CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden claiming under oath several times publicly speaking candidly classified conversations involving current president Donald J TRUM"
